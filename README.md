# Getting started with Nix
You've just created a new Nix repl. There's not much here yet but with a little work you can use it as the starting point for *ANYTHING*.
To get started there are 2 config files that you can use to customize the environment. To show them click the 3 dots menu button in the file tree and then click "Show config files".
* `replit.nix` - Configures the nix environment
* `.replit` - Configures the run command
